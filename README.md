# prework-study-guide

## Description

As a precursor to the OSU bootcamp course on coding and web development, I have built this webpage to learn new skills and begin building a databank to store some notes on the following coding languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition this will help me learn how to navigate and professionally use GitHub to create projects down the line. I have learned about the fundamentals of all of these and will use this webpage as a place to test out more code and skills as I develop them. I can also continuously update and expand on the information I have learned and made note of.

## Usage

The website contains notes about the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GitHub skills I have learned in the prework to the course. It also contains a great base website to build on and test out new code and skills in. In the DevTools console, we can see JavaScript running and update or expand on the code in place.
